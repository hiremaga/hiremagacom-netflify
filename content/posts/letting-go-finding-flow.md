title: Letting Go & Finding Flow - My Journey Through Rhythm

There’s a moment in the water, right after my first few strokes, when everything clicks. I stop thinking about the rest of the day. My body finds its rhythm, my mind lets go, and I just swim. In that moment, I feel what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow—that deep sense of immersion where everything feels right. But the truth is, it took a long time to find that rhythm, both in the pool and in my life. And I’ve learned that it’s not about finding the right routine, but about creating the conditions for something more sustainable— something more alive.

For years, I leaned heavily on routines. I’m a software engineer and manager; my world thrives on structure. I built routines to manage everything—work, family, exercise—and I thought if I could just get them perfect, I’d unlock some magic formula for balance. But it didn’t work. Instead, I burned out.

Looking back, the routines weren’t the problem. They were tools, but I had misunderstood their purpose. They weren’t meant to fix my life or bring balance on their own. They were there to support something deeper—a rhythm. It was only after stepping away, taking that leave, that I began to understand the difference.

During my leave, I spent time in India with family and friends, and I allowed myself to be fully present. No strict schedules, no performance metrics—just being. It reminded me of something Donald Winnicott talked about: the true self versus the false self. The false self is all about performance, living by external standards, while the true self is found when we’re free to be ourselves. The routines I had built before were for the false self—they were about productivity, achievement, getting things done. But that wasn’t who I wanted to be.

My therapist, who I’ll call Anya for privacy, helped me see this. She didn’t just push me to build better routines; she challenged me to understand what rhythms would allow my true self to emerge. I had to let go of the idea that routines were an end in themselves and see them instead as tools to help foster a deeper connection to my rhythm. This wasn’t about optimizing my day. It was about creating space for flow—those moments when everything aligns, whether I’m swimming laps or writing code.

I remember talking to one of the engineers on my team about this idea. He was struggling with his own routine, trying to balance work and personal growth. I told him something I wish someone had told me earlier: routines aren’t sacred. They’re a starting point, but they need to evolve with you. A rigid routine will burn you out, but if you let them serve your rhythm, you’ll thrive. Routines should help you move with the current of your life, not against it.

Now, I’m back at work and trying to hold onto that rhythm. I’ve learned to swim more, not just because it’s good for my body, but because it reminds me of how important rhythm is for my mind. I’m more thoughtful about the routines I build—dropping my son off at school, swimming, heading into work. These routines don’t bind me anymore; they’re the scaffolding that supports my flow. They’re flexible. And when I need to, I let them go.

It’s not perfect. I still catch myself slipping into old habits of wanting to control everything with structure. But I’m quicker now to pause, to reflect. I ask myself: Is this routine supporting my rhythm, or is it pulling me away from it? If it’s the latter, I know it’s time for a change. Because thriving, I’ve learned, is about listening to the rhythms of my life, not forcing them into a routine that no longer fits.

And honestly, this applies to everything. My work, my relationships, my mental health. It’s all about staying connected to that deeper sense of flow—creating space for it, protecting it. I’m still working on it, but I know now that when I lose my rhythm, it’s not about fixing the routine. It’s about finding my way back to what truly moves me.

That’s the balance I’ve been searching for, and it’s not something a perfectly engineered routine will give me. It’s in the rhythms that allow me to be fully present, in those moments when I stop thinking about what’s next and just swim.
