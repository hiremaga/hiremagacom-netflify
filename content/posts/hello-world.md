Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post on my redesigned site using Next.js and Markdown.

## Why the change?

I decided to simplify my blog setup and make it easier to maintain. Next.js provides a great developer experience with features like:

- Static site generation for optimal performance
- Built-in routing
- TypeScript support
- React components for reusable UI

## What's next?

In the coming weeks, I'll be migrating all my previous content to this new platform. Stay tuned for more posts about technology, programming, and other topics I'm passionate about.

```javascript
// A simple code example
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

Thanks for reading!
